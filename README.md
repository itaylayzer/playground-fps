# Playground FPS

a first person shooter playeground created with three.js and cannon-es \

the reason i created this playground is beacuse i found out that creating an fps character controller was difficult (couldnt find one that worked like i wanted), so i created myself.

inside this project i also created Animation Graph that should represent some basic copy of the UE5 or Unity Animation Graph. and also Blended Animations, which isnt a native option in three.

also had some use with three-nebula and mutch more. \
this playground isnt perfect, it misses alot of things, but it sure is the basic of an fps game.
